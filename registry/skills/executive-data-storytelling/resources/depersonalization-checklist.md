# Depersonalization Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your executive narrative focuses on problems and data, not blame or defensiveness.

## Before You Start

**Mindset shift:**

- You're presenting a problem to solve, not defending your team
- Executives want to understand what happened and what to do next
- Data-driven analysis builds trust; excuses erode it
- Depersonalization is professional, not cold - it shows maturity

## Language Audit

### Personal Pronouns Check

Search your narrative for these pronouns and consider eliminating or reducing:

- [ ] **"We"** - Found _____ times
  - Acceptable: "We recommend" (in NEXT section)
  - Problematic: "We struggled" "We couldn't" "We tried"

- [ ] **"Our"** - Found _____ times
  - Acceptable: "Our analysis shows" (data-focused)
  - Problematic: "Our team missed" "Our mistake"

- [ ] **"Us"** - Found _____ times
  - Usually problematic in executive narratives

- [ ] **"I" / "My"** - Found _____ times
  - Rarely appropriate in executive narratives
  - Exception: Solo founder/CEO presentations

**Goal:** Reduce personal pronouns by 70-80% in WHY section

---

## Defensive Language Check

Replace these defensive phrases with analytical alternatives:

## Transformation Techniques

### Technique 1: Use Passive Voice Strategically

While active voice is usually better, passive voice can depersonalize appropriately:

**Before (Personal):**

- We missed the revenue target by 18%

**After (Depersonalized):**

- Revenue target was missed by 18% due to enterprise sales cycle extension

**When to use:** When the actor is less important than the outcome or cause

---

### Technique 2: Focus on Systems and Processes

Identify systemic issues rather than individual or team failures:

**Before (Personal):**

- Our team didn't communicate well with stakeholders

**After (Systemic):**

- Stakeholder communication process lacked defined checkpoints, resulting in requirements misalignment discovered in week 6 of 8-week project

**When to use:** When the problem is structural, not just execution

---

### Technique 3: Use Data to Explain Causality

Let numbers tell the story without personal involvement:

**Before (Vague):**

- We couldn't ship fast enough

**After (Data-Driven):**

- Technical debt increased build time from 12 to 47 minutes, reducing deployment frequency from 3x/week to 1x/week, impacting feature velocity 67%

**When to use:** Always - data supports depersonalization naturally

---

### Technique 4: Externalize Appropriately

When external factors genuinely contributed, state them clearly (but don't overuse):

**Before (Blame):**

- The vendor didn't support us properly

**After (Factual):**

- Vendor API deprecation announced 3 weeks before deadline required 120 hours of unplanned refactoring

**When to use:** When external dependencies are documented and verifiable

---

### Technique 5: Acknowledge Lessons Learned

Show growth and adaptation without dwelling on blame:

**Before (Vague):**

- We won't make that mistake again

**After (Specific):**

- Post-mortem analysis identified 3 process improvements now implemented: (1) Architecture review before project kickoff, (2) Weekly stakeholder syncs, (3) Technical spike phase for unknowns

**When to use:** Always include in failure narratives - shows accountability and learning

---

## Section-Specific Guidelines

### WHAT Section (Current State)

**Depersonalization approach:** State facts objectively

- ✅ Use: "Revenue reached $8.2M vs $10M target"
- ❌ Avoid: "We missed our revenue target"

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Metrics stated without attribution to "we/our"
- [ ] Comparison to target/baseline is neutral
- [ ] No implied blame or responsibility

---

### WHY Section (Root Cause)

**Depersonalization approach:** Focus on factors, not people

- ✅ Use: "Enterprise sales cycle extended from 90 to 120 days due to increased budget scrutiny"
- ❌ Avoid: "We couldn't close deals fast enough"

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Root causes stated as factors, not team failures
- [ ] Data supports each causal claim
- [ ] External factors cited with evidence
- [ ] Systemic issues identified (not execution gaps)
- [ ] No defensive language ("struggled," "couldn't," etc.)
- [ ] Personal pronouns minimized (target: <5 uses)

---

### NEXT Section (Recommendations)

**Depersonalization approach:** Forward-looking, action-oriented

- ✅ Use: "Recommendation: Implement automated testing to reduce QA cycle time 40%"
- ❌ Avoid: "We need to do better at testing"

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Recommendations are specific actions, not vague commitments
- [ ] Outcomes are quantified and objective
- [ ] Focus is on the solution, not past mistakes
- [ ] Lessons learned inform recommendations without dwelling on blame

## Real Examples: Before and After

### Example 1: Product Launch Failure

**Before (Defensive and Personal):**
> "We launched the mobile app in Q2 but didn't get the adoption we hoped for. The team worked really hard on the features, but we probably should have done more marketing. We're going to try to fix it with a redesign and better promotion."

**After (Depersonalized and Analytical):**
> "Mobile app adoption reached 8,400 downloads vs 25,000 target in first 30 days. Post-launch analysis identified three primary factors: (1) App store optimization gaps resulting in position 47 vs competitor average position 12 for target keywords, (2) Onboarding friction with 64% abandonment vs 22% industry benchmark, (3) Marketing timing coincided with competitor's major promotion, reducing share of voice 73%. Revised plan targets 18,000 downloads by end of Q3 with optimized app store presence (projected position 8-12) and streamlined onboarding (targeting 41% abandonment based on testing)."

**What changed:**

- Eliminated "we" entirely
- Replaced "hoped for" with specific target
- Replaced "probably should have" with data-driven analysis
- Replaced "going to try" with quantified plan
- Added specific metrics throughout

---

### Example 2: Infrastructure Outage

**Before (Defensive and Personal):**
> "We had an outage last Thursday that took down the site for 3 hours. We didn't realize the database would run out of space. Our monitoring wasn't set up right. We're really sorry this happened and we're going to make sure it doesn't happen again."

**After (Depersonalized and Analytical):**
> "Service outage occurred Thursday, July 18, 14:23-17:41 PST (3.3 hours). Root cause: Database storage reached 100% capacity, triggering automatic failover. Contributing factors: (1) Storage monitoring threshold set at 90% with 24-hour alert window, insufficient given 15%/day growth rate, (2) Retention policy deleted logs after 90 days but archived data retention was unlimited. Impact: 14,200 users affected, $23K in SLA credits. Implemented remediation: (1) Monitoring thresholds adjusted to 75% with 4-hour alert window, (2) Automated storage cleanup for archived data >30 days, (3) Capacity planning dashboard to project storage needs 60 days forward. Expected outcome: Prevent similar incidents and provide 2-week early warning for capacity issues."

**What changed:**

- Removed all "we" and "our"
- Replaced "didn't realize" with root cause analysis
- Replaced apology with impact quantification
- Replaced "make sure it doesn't happen again" with specific controls
- Added preventive measures with expected outcomes

---

### Example 3: Missed Revenue Target

**Before (Defensive and Personal):**
> "We missed Q2 revenue because the market was tough and we had some challenges in the sales team. Our enterprise deals took longer than we expected and we lost a few key prospects to competitors. We're going to work harder to hit Q3 targets."

**After (Depersonalized and Analytical):**
> "Q2 revenue reached $8.2M vs $10M target (82% attainment). Analysis identified three factors: (1) Enterprise sales cycle extended from 90 to 120 days due to increased budget scrutiny (affecting 40% of pipeline), (2) Product compliance gaps delayed 40% of enterprise deals pending features launched in early Q3, (3) Competitive pricing pressure reduced average deal size 18% ($82K to $67K). Mitigation plan for Q3: (1) Accelerate compliance roadmap (launched July 15), (2) Introduce flexible payment terms for extended sales cycles (reduces upfront commitment 50%), (3) Revise Q3 targets to $9.2M reflecting current market reality and sales cycle data."

**What changed:**

- Eliminated personal pronouns
- Replaced "market was tough" with specific data (budget scrutiny, extended cycles)
- Replaced "challenges in sales team" with systemic factors (compliance gaps, pricing)
- Replaced "work harder" with specific mitigation plan with quantified outcomes
- Added adjusted targets based on data

## Final Checklist

Before submitting your narrative, verify:

**Language:**

- [ ] Personal pronouns reduced by 70-80% in WHY section
- [ ] No defensive phrases ("struggled," "couldn't," "tried to")
- [ ] Passive voice used strategically for depersonalization
- [ ] Focus on factors and systems, not people

**Content:**

- [ ] Root causes supported by data
- [ ] External factors cited with evidence (not excuses)
- [ ] Systemic issues identified and addressed
- [ ] Lessons learned inform recommendations

**Tone:**

- [ ] Analytical, not defensive
- [ ] Forward-looking in recommendations
- [ ] Transparent about failures without dwelling on blame
- [ ] Professional and confident

**Test:**

- [ ] Read aloud - does it sound defensive or analytical?
- [ ] Would you be comfortable if a competitor read this? (if yes, it's analytical)
- [ ] Does it inspire confidence in your analysis and plan? (if yes, depersonalization worked)

---

## Common Objections

**"But won't removing 'we' sound cold or robotic?"**

No. Executives want analysis, not personal narratives. Data-driven language sounds professional and mature. You can still be human in recommendations: "Recommendation: Invest in X" sounds more confident than "We think maybe we should try X."

**"But my team DID work hard - I want to acknowledge that!"**

Acknowledge effort privately with your team. In executive narratives, focus on outcomes and learnings. Executives know teams work hard - they want to know what happened and what to do next.

**"What if executives ask who was responsible?"**

Answer honestly and factually: "The project was led by [name/team], and the root cause analysis identified systemic gaps in [process]." Then immediately pivot to remediation: "The controls now in place prevent recurrence."

**"Isn't this just avoiding accountability?"**

No - it's demonstrating accountability through analysis and solutions. Saying "we failed" is less accountable than showing "factor X caused outcome Y, and here's the control to prevent it." True accountability is learning and improving, not self-flagellation.

## Practice Exercise

**Take this defensive narrative and depersonalize it:**

> "We missed our launch date by 6 weeks because we underestimated how complex the integration would be. Our team worked really hard but we couldn't get the API working properly and we had to keep going back to fix bugs. We didn't have enough testing time and the requirements kept changing. We're sorry for the delay and we're going to be more careful with estimates next time."

**Your depersonalized version:**

[Write your version here]

**Suggested solution:**

> "Product launch occurred 6 weeks behind schedule (target: May 15, actual: June 26). Root cause analysis identified: (1) API integration complexity was 3x initial estimate due to undocumented endpoint dependencies, requiring 240 additional engineering hours, (2) Requirements volatility increased 35% mid-project as customer feedback from parallel beta program influenced scope, (3) Testing phase compressed from 4 weeks to 1.5 weeks to minimize additional delay, resulting in 23 critical bugs identified in production first week. Process improvements implemented: (1) API integration spike phase before commitment (2-week discovery with vendor), (2) Requirements freeze policy at 50% project completion unless critical, (3) Testing phase non-negotiable minimum 3 weeks regardless of schedule pressure. Expected outcome for next similar project: Estimation accuracy within 15%, schedule variance reduced to 1-2 weeks maximum."

**Key improvements:**

- Removed all "we" and "our"
- Replaced "underestimated" with specific data (3x complexity)
- Replaced "couldn't get working" with technical specifics
- Replaced "sorry" with impact quantification
- Replaced "be more careful" with specific process controls
