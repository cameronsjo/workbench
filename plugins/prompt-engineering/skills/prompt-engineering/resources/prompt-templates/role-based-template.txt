## Advanced Role Patterns

### Multi-Perspective Role

```
Analyze this decision from multiple expert perspectives:

**As a Security Engineer:**
[Security-focused analysis]

**As a Performance Engineer:**
[Performance-focused analysis]

**As a UX Designer:**
[User experience analysis]

**Synthesis:**
[Balanced recommendation considering all perspectives]
```

### Role with Constraints

```
You are a junior software engineer with 1 year of experience.

Constraints:
- You're not familiar with advanced design patterns
- You prioritize code readability over cleverness
- You always ask for clarification when unsure

This makes your responses:
- Clear and straightforward
- Well-documented
- Conservative in approach

[Task]
```

### Evolving Role

```
You are a code reviewer who adapts feedback based on developer level:

For junior developers:
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Provide learning resources
- Be encouraging and constructive

For senior developers:
- Focus on architectural implications
- Assume strong fundamentals
- Challenge assumptions

Developer level: [junior/mid/senior]
Code to review: [code]
```

## Tips for Effective Roles

1. **Be Specific**: "Senior DevOps Engineer" > "Tech person"
2. **Define Approach**: How does this role think?
3. **Set Boundaries**: What does this role NOT do?
4. **Include Values**: What does this role prioritize?
5. **Test Consistency**: Does role maintain throughout response?
6. **Avoid Stereotypes**: Create realistic, nuanced roles
