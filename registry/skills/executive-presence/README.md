# Executive Presence Skill

Building executive presence through intentional personal brand development based on Gartner research methodology.

## Overview

Executive presence is not innate charisma or personality. It is the deliberate alignment of your image, impressions, and impact to create influence. Most leaders overestimate their self-awareness: 90% believe they have executive presence, but only 15% actually demonstrate it.

This skill provides a research-backed framework for:

- Discovering your current brand through structured observation and conversations
- Evaluating brand perceptions against market needs and personal values
- Establishing your zone of distinction (the intersection of market need, your values, and your market value)
- Distilling an aspirational brand promise that drives executive presence
- Recalibrating (not reinventing) your professional brand

## Quick Start

Claude will automatically invoke this skill when you discuss:

- Building or enhancing executive presence

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: Career Transition**
> "I'm transitioning from a technical leadership role to a business leadership role. I keep getting feedback that I'm 'too in the weeds' and not strategic enough. How do I build executive presence for this new role?"

Claude will use this skill to guide you through brand discovery, identify the gap between "technical expert" and "business strategist" brands, and develop a recalibration strategy.

**Example 2: Promotion Readiness**
> "I want to be promoted to VP level but I'm not sure if I have the executive presence. How do I know if I'm ready and what I need to work on?"

Claude will use this skill to help you discover your current brand, identify your zone of distinction, and create an aspirational brand promise aligned with VP-level expectations.

**Example 3: Influence Without Authority**
> "I need to influence senior stakeholders but don't have positional authority. How do I build presence and credibility?"

Claude will use this skill to help you understand how to build image, impressions, and impact through strategic brand positioning.

## Core Concepts

**The Three Phases of Executive Presence:**

1. **IMAGE** - What people know and think based on your status and reputation
2. **IMPRESSIONS** - What people feel based on your appearances and communications
3. **IMPACT** - What people do because of their experiences with you

**The Zone of Distinction:**

Your unique value proposition exists at the intersection of:

- **Market Need** - What matters to your enterprise
- **Your Values** - What matters to you
- **Your Market Value** - What you are good at

**Brand Promise:**

A 2-3 word statement that represents the distinctive value or experiences your market can expect from you. Avoid generic descriptions like "dependable technologist" - aim for distinctive positioning like "digital transformation catalyst."

## Common Scenarios

This skill helps with:

- **"I'm seen as too technical"** - Recalibrate from technical expert to business strategist
- **"I'm seen as not strategic"** - Recalibrate from tactical executor to strategic partner
- **"I'm seen as indecisive"** - Recalibrate from consensus-builder to decisive leader
- **"I'm seen as abrasive"** - Recalibrate from results-at-all-costs to results-with-relationships
- **"I'm inheriting a negative brand"** - Distance from predecessor and establish contrasting brand
