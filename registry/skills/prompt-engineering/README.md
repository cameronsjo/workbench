# Prompt Engineering Skill

Expert guidance for crafting effective prompts for LLMs using proven techniques and patterns.

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive expertise for:
- Designing prompts for Claude, GPT, and other LLMs
- Optimizing prompts for consistency and performance
- Implementing chain-of-thought reasoning
- Creating few-shot learning examples
- Building prompt pipelines
- Testing and evaluating prompt effectiveness

## Quick Start

Claude will automatically invoke this skill when you:
- Ask about prompt engineering or prompt design
- Need to optimize LLM prompts
- Want to improve AI feature outputs
- Mention few-shot, chain-of-thought, or prompting techniques
- Need to test prompt variations

## What's Included

- **SKILL.md**: Comprehensive prompting techniques and patterns
- **resources/**: Ready-to-use prompt templates and pattern catalog
- **scripts/**: Evaluation and testing tools
- **examples/**: Real-world prompt examples

## Key Techniques Covered

### Core Prompting Methods
- Zero-shot prompting
- Few-shot learning
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
- Role-based prompting
- Self-consistency
- Prompt chaining
- Constitutional AI principles

### Advanced Patterns
- Meta-prompting
- Recursive prompting
- Multi-perspective analysis
- Prompt injection prevention
- Token optimization

### Model-Specific Guidance
- Claude (Anthropic) best practices
- GPT-4 (OpenAI) optimization
- Context window strategies
- Temperature and sampling

## Usage Examples

```
# Optimizing a prompt
"Improve this prompt for better consistency: [prompt]"

# Designing a new prompt
"Create a prompt for code review that checks security and performance"

# Testing variations
"Generate A/B test variations of this prompt"

# Debugging poor outputs
"This prompt produces inconsistent results: [prompt]. How can I fix it?"
```
