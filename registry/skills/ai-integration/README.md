# AI/LLM Integration Skill

Build production-ready AI/LLM applications with RAG systems, vector search, and agent orchestration.

## Quick Start

Claude automatically invokes this skill when you mention:
- RAG, retrieval augmented generation
- Vector search, embeddings, semantic search
- LLM integration, OpenAI, Claude API
- AI features, chatbots
- Agent orchestration

## What's Included

Comprehensive AI/LLM development guidance:
- RAG system architecture and implementation
- Vector databases (ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate)
- LLM API integration (Claude, GPT, others)
- Embeddings and semantic search
- Agent orchestration patterns
- Cost optimization and caching
- Error handling and rate limiting

## Usage Examples

```
"Build a RAG system for document search"
"Integrate Claude API with streaming responses"
"Setup vector search with ChromaDB"
"Create an agent with tools for web search and calculation"
"Optimize LLM costs with response caching"
```
