# Roadmap Review

Review the project roadmap and provide a status summary.

## Instructions

1. Read `docs/ROADMAP.md` to get the current state
2. Summarize:
   - **In Progress**: What's actively being worked on
   - **Planned (High Impact)**: What's ready to start
   - **Ideas Worth Considering**: High-impact ideas that should be evaluated
3. Identify any stale items (ideas sitting too long without action)
4. Suggest what to work on next based on impact/effort ratio

## Output Format

```
## Roadmap Status

### In Progress
- [item] - brief status

### Ready to Start (High Impact)
- [item] - why it matters

### Ideas to Evaluate
- [item] - potential impact

### Suggestions
- What to tackle next and why
```

Keep it concise - this is a quick status check, not a deep dive.
