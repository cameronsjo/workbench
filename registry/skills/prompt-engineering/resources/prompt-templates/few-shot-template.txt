### Example 2: Code Comment Generation

Generate descriptive comments for these functions:

Examples:
Code:
```python
def calculate_total(items, tax_rate):
    subtotal = sum(item.price for item in items)
    return subtotal * (1 + tax_rate)
```

Comment:

### Example 3: Data Transformation

Transform user data from input format to output format:

Examples:
Input: "name: John Doe, age: 30, city: NYC"
Output: {"full_name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "location": "NYC"}

Input: "name: Jane Smith, age: 25, city: SF"
Output: {"full_name": "Jane Smith", "age": 25, "location": "SF"}

Input: "name: Bob Johnson, age: 40, city: LA"
Output: {"full_name": "Bob Johnson", "age": 40, "location": "LA"}

Transform:
Input: "[your input]"
Output:

## Best Practices

1. Use 3-5 diverse examples
2. Include edge cases in examples
3. Show exact desired format
4. Cover spectrum of variations
5. Ensure examples are consistent
6. Make examples representative

## When to Use Few-Shot

- Need specific format or style
- Edge cases need clarification
- Consistency is critical
- Zero-shot results vary too much
- Task pattern needs demonstration

## Tips

- More examples = more consistent, but also more tokens
- Quality > quantity for examples
- Include challenging cases
- Keep examples concise but complete
