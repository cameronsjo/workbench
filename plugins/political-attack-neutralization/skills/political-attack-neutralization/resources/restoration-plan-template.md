# Restoration Plan Template

**Critical:** Plan restoration BEFORE taking neutralization action. Never neutralize without a restoration plan.

## Why Restoration Matters

Neutralizing without restoration will:
- ❌ Appear vengeful and damage your reputation
- ❌ Create an enemy who will wait to retaliate
- ❌ Undermine your credibility as a leader
- ❌ Damage relationships across the organization

Neutralizing WITH restoration will:
- ✅ Strengthen your reputation as principled leader
- ✅ Create accountability without creating enemies
- ✅ Lead to stronger relationships long-term
- ✅ Improve enterprise culture

## Restoration Trigger

**Restoration begins ONLY after:**

- [ ] Stakeholder has gotten the message
- [ ] Apologized or acknowledged the missteps
- [ ] Committed to refraining from similar behavior in future

**Warning:** Do NOT restore prematurely. They must:
1. Understand why their behavior was problematic
2. Take accountability (not just apologize to placate)
3. Show genuine commitment to change

## Restoration Action Planning

- **Dignity** - Treating them with respect after accountability
- **Moving forward together** - Partnering on solutions
- **Reciprocating with something material they value** - Real actions, not just words
- **Visible partnership in view of enterprise** - Others see you working together

### What Restoration is NOT

❌ Restoration is NOT:
- Explaining why you were right and they were wrong
- Making them feel small
- Holding grudges
- Keeping them on probation indefinitely
- Pretending the incident didn't happen
- Letting them off the hook

**Fix:** Wait for genuine acknowledgment and commitment to change

### Mistake 2: Symbolic vs. Material Restoration

**Fix:** Provide something of real value to them

### Mistake 3: Private Neutralization, Private Restoration
**Problem:** If neutralization was public, restoration must be too
**Fix:** Match restoration visibility to neutralization visibility

### Mistake 4: Conditional Restoration
**Problem:** "I'll restore you IF you prove yourself over time"
