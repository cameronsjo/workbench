# Aspirational Brand List Template

Create 5-8 characteristics that represent your aspirational brand - how you want to be known.

## Core Principle

**Focus on DISTINCTION, not generic excellence.**

Generic excellence is forgettable. Distinctive positioning is memorable.

❌ Avoid: "Strategic thinker," "Good communicator," "Team player"
✅ Target: "Business outcome architect," "Technical translator for executives," "Cross-functional catalyst"

## Guidelines

Before creating your list, review these principles:

### 1. Avoid Role Expectations

Everyone expects a CIO to be "strategic" or a product manager to be "customer-focused." Don't waste brand real estate on table stakes.

### 2. Use Specific, Memorable Language

Vague descriptors don't stick. Vivid language creates mental images.

### 3. Think About Application

What does this characteristic look like in action? If you can't visualize specific behaviors, refine it.

### 4. Consider Your Market Context

What's valuable and scarce in your organization? Your brand should address market needs.

### 5. Stay Authentic

Can you sustain this brand over time? Does it align with your values and capabilities?
