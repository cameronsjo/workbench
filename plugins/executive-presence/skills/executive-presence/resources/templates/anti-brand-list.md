# Anti-Brand List Template

Your anti-brand list defines what you need to STOP doing, delegate, or minimize to enable your aspirational brand.

## Core Principle

**What you stop doing is as important as what you start doing.**

Your anti-brand list has three categories:

1. Pessimistic perceptions you want to eliminate
2. Activities that impede your aspirational brand
3. Inherited or generic brand perceptions you need to distance from

## Warren Buffett's "Avoid at All Costs" Approach

Warren Buffett famously creates two lists:

1. Goals he wants to achieve
2. Goals to avoid at all costs (because they distract from #1)

Your anti-brand list is your "avoid at all costs" list for brand development.
