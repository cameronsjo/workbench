# Presentation Frameworks by Communication Style

## Multi-Style Presentation Layer Structure

When presenting to groups with diverse styles, structure content in progressive layers that address each style sequentially.

### The Four-Layer Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LAYER 1: DRIVER (15 seconds)                    │
│ What's the decision? What's the impact?         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LAYER 2: EXPRESSIVE (30 seconds)                │
│ Why should they care? What's the vision?        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LAYER 3: ANALYTIC (2 minutes)                   │
│ What's the data? What's the methodology?        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                      ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LAYER 4: AMIABLE (1 minute)                     │
│ Who's involved? How does this help teams?       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Order:**
1. **Driver first:** Hooks executives immediately, respects their time
2. **Expressive second:** Builds emotional engagement once results are clear
3. **Analytic third:** Provides logical foundation after interest is established
4. **Amiable last:** Addresses implementation concerns before Q&A
