# Explore Mode

Launching the **Explore agent** to investigate your codebase quickly.

The Explore agent will search, read, and analyze the codebase to answer your question with file references and code examples.

**Thoroughness levels:**
- **quick**: Basic search (fast, good for simple lookups)
- **medium**: Moderate exploration (default, balanced)
- **very thorough**: Comprehensive analysis (deep dive)

**Example questions:**
- "Where are authentication endpoints?"
- "How does the caching system work?"
- "Find all database query patterns"
- "What files implement the OAuth flow?"
