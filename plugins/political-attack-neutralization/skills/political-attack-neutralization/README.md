# Political Attack Neutralization

Quick reference for neutralizing political attacks using appropriate power while maintaining professional relationships.

## Quick Start

**When to use this framework:**
- Verbal diplomacy has failed
- Behavior damages team/project/enterprise
- Pattern of inappropriate behavior exists
- Enterprise values/policies are violated

**When NOT to use:**
- Issue can be resolved through diplomacy
- You lack power to follow through
- Collateral damage outweighs benefits
- You can't/won't restore the person afterward
- Acting out of anger rather than principle

## The MOAR Framework

```
MESSAGE → OBSTRUCT → AGITATE → RESTORE
```

### 1. MESSAGE
Craft clear four-part message:
1. NAME the behavior
2. STATE why it's problematic
3. HOLD accountable
4. MAKE consequences clear

### 2. OBSTRUCT
Use power proportionately to obstruct negative behavior.

**Before acting, assess:**
- Do you have power to neutralize?
- Are you willing to use it?
- What's the collateral damage?
- Will this end, delay, or escalate the issue?

### 3. AGITATE
Allow only as much agitation as necessary to ensure message is understood.

**Agitation levels:**
- Private discussion (minor, first occurrence)
- Public discussion (repeated, small team impact)
- Enterprise communication (policy violation)
- Enterprise policy (severe, everyone needs to know)

### 4. RESTORE
**Essential for positive long-term relationship.**

Restore ONLY after:
- Stakeholder gets the message
- Apologizes or acknowledges missteps
- Commits to refraining from similar behavior

## Critical Warning

⚠️  **Neutralizing without restoration will:**
- Appear vengeful and damage your reputation
- Create an enemy who will wait to retaliate
- Undermine your credibility as a leader

**Never skip restoration.**
