## Explicit CoT Examples

### Example 1: Math Problem

Problem: A store offers 20% off on all items. If a shirt originally costs $50 and there's an additional $5 coupon, what's the final price?

Let's think step by step:
1. First, calculate 20% of $50: 0.20 × $50 = $10 discount
2. Subtract the discount from original price: $50 - $10 = $40
3. Apply the $5 coupon: $40 - $5 = $35
4. Final price is $35

Total savings: $50 - $35 = $15

### Example 2: Debugging Problem

Problem: Why does this code throw an error?

```python
def process_users(users):
    for user in users:
        print(user.name.upper())
```

Error: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'upper'

Let's analyze step by step:
1. Error is AttributeError on 'upper()' method
2. This means 'name' is None for at least one user
3. Need to check if 'name' exists and is not None before calling .upper()
4. Should add defensive check: if user.name: print(user.name.upper())

Solution: Add null check before accessing methods on potentially None values.

### Example 3: Design Decision

Problem: Should we use REST or GraphQL for our new API?

Let's evaluate step by step:
1. Analyze our requirements:
   - Multiple client types (web, mobile, internal)
   - Complex nested data structures
   - Need for flexible queries

2. Consider REST:
   - Pros: Simple, well-understood, good caching
   - Cons: Over-fetching, multiple requests for nested data

3. Consider GraphQL:
   - Pros: Flexible queries, single request, typed schema
   - Cons: More complex, harder to cache, learning curve

4. Match requirements to strengths:
   - Flexible queries → GraphQL advantage
   - Nested data → GraphQL advantage
   - Multiple clients → Both work, GraphQL slightly better

Recommendation: GraphQL due to flexible querying and nested data requirements, despite higher initial complexity.

## Implicit CoT (Show Reasoning in Examples)

Examples:
Question: If 5 apples cost $10, how much do 8 apples cost?
Reasoning: First find cost per apple: $10 ÷ 5 = $2 per apple. Then multiply by 8: $2 × 8 = $16
Answer: $16

## When to Use CoT

- Multi-step reasoning required
- Math or logic problems
- Complex decision-making
- Debugging or troubleshooting
- Need to show work/reasoning
- Want explainable AI outputs

## Effectiveness

- Significantly improves accuracy on reasoning tasks
- Makes model's logic transparent
- Helps catch errors in reasoning
- Better for complex problems than simple ones

## Variations

1. **Explicit CoT**: "Let's think step by step..."
2. **Implicit CoT**: Show reasoning in examples
3. **Tree of Thoughts**: Multiple reasoning paths
4. **Self-Verification**: Add "Let's verify this answer"
