### Request Template

Use this template when scheduling:

```
Hi [Name],

I'm working on my professional development and would value your honest advice.

Could we schedule 30-45 minutes for me to ask you a few questions about how you experience working with me? I'm seeking critical, actionable input - not politeness or praise.

I promise:
- Not to defend or pushback on anything you share
- To listen and take notes
- To use this only for my own development

Would [suggest 2-3 times] work for you?

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

### Ground Rules (Review at Start of Each Conversation)

Remind yourself and your conversation partner:

- **This is advice, not feedback** - I want your honest, critical input
- **No pushback or defending** - My job is to listen and understand
- **Neutral location** - Not my office (creates power dynamic)
- **No devices** - I'll take notes, but full attention on you
- **Examples are helpful** - When you mention something, I'll ask for examples
- **Confidentiality** - This is for my development, not evaluation

## Conversation Opening

**Script:**

"Thank you for taking the time to help me with my professional development. I'm working on understanding how others perceive me so I can be more intentional about my leadership brand.

I'm going to ask you questions across four areas: strategic thinking, decision-making, communication, and relationship building. I want your honest assessment - this is most valuable when it's critical and specific.

I promise not to defend or explain anything you share. My job is just to listen and understand.

Can I ask: what are your ground rules or preferences for this conversation?"

[Listen to their needs, then proceed]
