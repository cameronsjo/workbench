## Proportionality Check

Match your response level to the severity of the situation:

| Severity | Behavior Examples | Appropriate Response |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Low** | First-time minor violation, no pattern | Private discussion, verbal correction |
| **Medium** | Repeated behavior, small team impact | Public discussion, documented warning |
| **High** | Policy violation, department impact | Enterprise communication, resource actions |
| **Severe** | Values violation, everyone needs to know | Enterprise policy update, severe consequences |

**Severity of this situation:** [ ] Low [ ] Medium [ ] High [ ] Severe

**Your planned response level:** [ ] Private [ ] Public [ ] Enterprise [ ] Policy

**Assessment:**
- [ ] Response is proportionate to severity
- [ ] Using minimum necessary force
- [ ] Not over-reacting or under-reacting

## Alternative Options Analysis

Before proceeding, consider alternatives:

### Option 1: Verbal Diplomacy (One More Try)
- [ ] Could this still work?
- [ ] Have I truly exhausted diplomatic options?
- [ ] Is there a new angle I haven't tried?

### Option 2: Escalation to Superior
- [ ] Would escalation be more effective?
- [ ] Do I lack sufficient power?
- [ ] Would my superior handle it better?

### Option 3: Structural/Process Changes
- [ ] Could we change the process to prevent this?
- [ ] Would systemic changes be better than individual action?
- [ ] Can we remove the opportunity for this behavior?

### Option 4: Accept and Monitor
- [ ] Is the damage truly significant enough?
- [ ] Could this resolve itself?
- [ ] Should I monitor longer before acting?
