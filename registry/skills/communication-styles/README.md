# Communication Style Flexing Skill

Master the art of adapting your communication style to build rapport, influence decisions, and collaborate effectively with any stakeholder using the research-backed Social Styles Framework.

## Overview

Effective collaboration requires good working rapport with key business partners. Clashing communication styles cause friction, missed opportunities, and stalled initiatives. This skill teaches you how to diagnose communication styles using the Social Styles Framework and flex your approach to match others.

Based on Gartner research (G00799890, August 2023), this skill helps you understand four distinct social styles - Amiable, Expressive, Analytic, and Driver - and provides practical strategies for adapting your communication to resonate with anyone.

## The Four Social Styles

```
                      RELATIONSHIP
                           ↑
                AMIABLE  |  EXPRESSIVE
           (People)      |      (Ideas)
      ASK ←────────────────────────────→ TELL
           (Process)     |     (Results)
                ANALYTIC |    DRIVER
                           ↓
                         TASK
```

**AMIABLE** (Relationship + Ask)
- Focus: People and consensus
- Tagline: "Let me discuss this with my team"
- Power words: Guarantee, reliable, tested, safety

**EXPRESSIVE** (Relationship + Tell)
- Focus: Ideas and recognition
- Tagline: "Here are my ideas about this"
- Power words: Innovative, exciting, creative, appreciate

**ANALYTIC** (Task + Ask)
- Focus: Process and accuracy
- Tagline: "Let me think how it could work"
- Power words: Research, data, evidence, proven

**DRIVER** (Task + Tell)
- Focus: Results and action
- Tagline: "Let's take action on this"
- Power words: ROI, results, fast, efficiency

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: Executive Email**

Prompt: "I need to email the CFO requesting budget approval for a $100K project that will save $500K annually. She's very results-focused and impatient with details."

Claude loads this skill, diagnoses CFO as DRIVER style, and crafts:
```
Subject: Project X Approval Needed - $500K Savings

[CFO Name],

Bottom line: Requesting approval for Project X.

RESULTS: $500K annual savings, 20% efficiency gain
TIMELINE: 60 days to delivery
DECISION NEEDED: Approve $100K budget by Friday

Options:
1. Full rollout (recommended) - $100K, $500K return
2. Pilot program - $25K, $125K return
3. Delay until Q2 - $0, miss savings window

I recommend Option 1 for maximum ROI.

What's your decision?
```

**Example 2: Conflict Resolution**

Prompt: "Two team members are clashing. One wants to move fast and make decisions quickly. The other keeps saying they need more time to get team buy-in. How do I resolve this?"

Claude identifies Driver vs. Amiable conflict (opposite styles) and provides:
- Analysis of why opposite styles create maximum tension
- Bridge strategy: Give Amiable specific deadline for consensus, give Driver visibility into progress
- Specific conversation frameworks for each person
- Joint meeting structure that honors both needs

**Example 3: Mixed Audience Presentation**

Prompt: "I'm presenting our new data platform to the leadership team. The CTO is very technical and detail-oriented, the CPO loves vision and stories, the CEO wants bottom-line results fast, and the CHRO cares about team impact."

Claude creates multi-layer presentation structure:
- Layer 1: Driver executive summary (15 seconds)
- Layer 2: Expressive emotional hook (30 seconds)
- Layer 3: Analytic logical foundation (2 minutes)
- Layer 4: Amiable collaborative framing (1 minute)
- Plus Q&A strategies for each leader's style

## Quick Reference

**20-Second Diagnostic:**
1. Relationship vs. Task? (People or results focus)
2. Ask vs. Tell? (Questions or statements)
3. Combine: Relationship+Ask=Amiable, Relationship+Tell=Expressive, Task+Ask=Analytic, Task+Tell=Driver

**Flexing Rules:**
- AMIABLES: Slow down, connect personally, seek consensus
- EXPRESSIVES: Add energy, tell stories, recognize contributions
- ANALYTICS: Provide data, be precise, give time to analyze
- DRIVERS: Get to the point, focus on results, save their time

**Maximum Tension (Opposites):**
- Amiable ↔ Driver (consensus vs. speed)
- Expressive ↔ Analytic (story vs. data)
