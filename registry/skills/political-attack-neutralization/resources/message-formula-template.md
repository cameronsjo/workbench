# Message Formula Template

Use this template to craft your four-part message when neutralizing political attacks.

## The Four-Part Formula

### 1. NAME the Behavior

**Template:** "Behavior X of yours violates this principle..."

**Your message:**
```
[Specific behavior] violates [specific policy/principle/value]
```

**Examples:**
- "Signing vendor contracts without involving procurement and architecture review violates our enterprise governance policy"
- "Publicly blaming other teams without first understanding the full situation damages cross-functional trust"
- "Allocating shared resources exclusively to your initiatives prevents the enterprise from delivering on strategic priorities"

**Tips:**
- Be specific about the behavior (not the person)
- Reference specific policies, values, or principles
- Use neutral, factual language

---

### 2. STATE Why It's Problematic

**Template:** "Behavior X causes problem Y..."

**Your message:**
```
This creates [specific negative impact] and [broader consequences]
```

**Examples:**
- "This creates compliance risk and sets a precedent others might follow"
- "This prevents the enterprise from delivering on strategic priorities"
- "This damages cross-functional trust and is not consistent with our values"

**Tips:**
- Focus on business/enterprise impact
- Include both immediate and potential future consequences
- Avoid making it personal

---

### 3. HOLD Accountable

**Template:**
- "Please stop that."
- "Please fix the damage X caused."

**Your message:**
```
[Specific corrective action required]
```

**Examples:**
- "The contract must be reviewed for compliance, and all remediation costs will be charged to your budget"
- "We need to review the timeline together and agree on facts"
- "Please release 3 engineers to work on the customer platform initiative"

**Tips:**
- Be clear and specific about what must happen
- Include timeline if appropriate
- Make it actionable

---

### 4. MAKE Consequences Clear

**Template:**
- "Or there will be consequences."
- "And that applies to everyone else as well."

**Your message:**
```
Future violations will result in [specific escalation or consequence]
```

**Examples:**
- "Future violations will be escalated to the executive committee"
- "Further public blame-shifting will require executive mediation"
- "Continued resource hoarding will result in centralized resource allocation"

**Tips:**
- Be clear about what happens if behavior continues
- Make consequences proportionate
- Apply consistently to all

- Department communication: Reference policy/principle
- Enterprise-wide: Policy reminder or update

**Tone:**
- Professional and neutral
- Firm but not angry
- Focus on behavior and impact, not person
