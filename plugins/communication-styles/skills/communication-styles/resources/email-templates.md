Subject: Seeking Your Input on Analytics Tool for Our Teams

Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out because I've been hearing from several team members about challenges with our current analytics process.

After discussing with the team, there's consensus that a new tool could really help reduce the manual work everyone's doing and improve our work-life balance.

WHAT THE TEAM IS SAYING:
- Current process is time-consuming and frustrating
- People are working late to compile reports
- Concerns about accuracy with manual processes

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
We've been looking at an analytics tool that could automate much of this work. It would cost $50K annually but could save our teams about 200 hours per month.

I'd really value your thoughts on this. Does this feel like something that would help our teams? Are there concerns we should discuss together?

I'm happy to meet with you and go over this in detail.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

**This is weak for ALL styles. Here's how to strengthen:**

**AMIABLE rewrite:**
"Thank you for the great conversation yesterday! I really valued hearing your perspective and your team's concerns. After reflecting on what you shared, I think moving forward could help address the challenges we discussed - but I want to make sure this feels right to you and your team. Would you be open to discussing this further?"

2. **For unknown recipients:** Use multi-layer structure (all four styles in sequence)
3. **For urgent matters:** Always include DRIVER elements (bottom line, deadline, decision needed)
4. **For sensitive topics:** Always include AMIABLE elements (personal connection, consensus)
5. **Watch response patterns:** If they reply in their style, mirror it in your next email
6. **Subject line is critical:** 50% of engagement happens before email is opened
7. **First sentence matters most:** Front-load most important information by style
8. **Attachments by style:**
   - Amiables: Implementation impact on teams
   - Expressives: Visual one-pagers with stories
   - Analytics: Detailed analysis and methodology
   - Drivers: One-page executive summary with ROI

Remember: The goal is not manipulation but removing communication barriers to enable effective collaboration.
