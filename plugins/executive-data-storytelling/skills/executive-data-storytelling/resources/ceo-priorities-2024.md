## Priority Mapping Strategy

### Step 1: Identify Your Primary Priority Connection

For your metric or initiative, ask:

1. **Does this directly impact revenue or growth?** → Growth
2. **Does this involve technology capabilities or risk?** → Technology
3. **Does this affect talent or culture?** → Workforce
4. **Does this improve costs, efficiency, or ROI?** → Financial

### Step 2: Identify Secondary Connections

Most initiatives connect to multiple priorities. Show the full impact:

**Example:** Design thinking labs

- **Primary**: Technology (29%) - Innovation and new capabilities
- **Secondary**: Financial (22%) - $2.3M in operational cost savings
- **Tertiary**: Workforce (25%) - Employee engagement through idea contribution

### Step 3: Use CEO Priority Language

**Translation table:**

| Your department language | CEO priority language |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| "Reduced build time" | "Increased developer productivity" (Workforce) or "Accelerated time-to-market" (Growth) |
| "Fixed 47 bugs" | "Improved product reliability" (Technology) or "Reduced support costs 18%" (Financial) |
| "Hired 12 engineers" | "Built capacity for new product initiatives" (Growth) |
| "Migrated to cloud" | "Modernized infrastructure to enable scalability" (Technology) |
| "Implemented new training" | "Developed critical skills for AI roadmap" (Workforce + Technology) |
| "Consolidated vendors" | "Optimized operational costs by $340K annually" (Financial) |

### Step 4: Quantify the Connection

Always include specific numbers that tie to CEO priorities:

**Weak connection:**

- "We improved our deployment process" (no priority connection, no quantification)

**Strong connection:**

- "Improved deployment process from 3 weeks to 3 days, enabling 4x faster feature delivery to support our growth roadmap" (Growth priority, quantified impact)

**Stronger connection:**

- "Deployment process improvement (3 weeks → 3 days) accelerated our product roadmap 2 months, enabling Q3 enterprise tier launch that captures $4.5M additional revenue this year" (Growth + Technology priorities, business outcome quantified)
